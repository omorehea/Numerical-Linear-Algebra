README file for the numerical portion of HW3. within the code subdirectory, the subsubdirectory prob1_Cholesky contains the numerical code needed
to run the Cholesky Decomposition method to obtain an approximate solution to the least squares problem using both a 3rd and 5th degree polynomial fit.
The subsubdirectory prob2_QR contains the numerical code needed to run the QR Factorization method to obtain an approximate solution to the least square problem
using the same degree polynomial fits. 
Running and compiling the code in both subdirectories entails the exact same process. Once inside the subdirectory, using your compiler of choice, first type "make LinAl" followed by "./ LinAl". 
This will print all the results to the screen as well as save the best fit polynomial coefficients to a .dat file for both the 3rd and 5th degree fits.
A deliverables report can be found under the report subdirectory.
