README file for the numerical portion of HW4. Within the code subdirectory, there are the associated fortran files for this assignment.
Once inside the subdirectory, to run and compile the code, use your compiler of choice to first type "make LinAl", followed by "./LinAl" to compile the program 
and print all the results to the screen.
This program does the following in order: 
Reduces a symmetric matrix to tridiagonal form using Householder matrices for the similarity transformations.
Uses the QR algorithm without and with shift to calculate the eigenvalues of a matrix.
Uses the inverse iteration method to calcualte the corresponding eigenvectors of a matrix given the approximate eigenvalues. 
A deliverables report can be found under the report subdirectory.
