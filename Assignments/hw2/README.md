README file for HW2. Part 1 contains the numerical code and report directories. To run and compile the code type "make LinAl" followed by "./ LinAl". 
This program performs both Gaussian elimination and LU decomposition on the linear system of equations defined by Ax = b. 4x4 matrix A is stored in Amat.dat and the 
6 right hand side column vectors are stored in the 4x6 matrix B. For both routines, the solution matrix, x, is printed to the screen as well as the error matrix
and the norm of the columns of the error matrix. 
Lastly an application problem is solved using GE method. Here we find the equation of the plane that connects points A, B, and C. Printed to the screen is both 
the augmented matrix that is being solved and the resulting solution coeficients to the planes equation. 
A deliverables report can be found under the report directory.   

Under the part 2 directory is a pdf of the solved theory problems. There is no code associated to this part.
