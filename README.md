# Numerical-Linear-Algebra
A collection of numerical linear algebra routines used for varying problems. Code and deliverables both available.
All code written in Fortran 90.
To compile code, one can use the makefile present in each code subdirectory:
-> make LinAl
-> ./LinAl

Or one can compile and run by the satandard method with Fortran files:
-> gfortran -o 'executables name' 'Heiarchy list of files to compile. Driver program listed last.'
-> ./'executables name'
